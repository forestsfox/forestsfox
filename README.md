I'm a:
- physics grad with a bent for all things computing
- generalist/polymath/autodidact in constant pursuit of mastery over the machine at all levels of abstraction
- big-time fanboy of robust, scalable engineering, and fast execution speeds

I like:
- physical systems
- software systems
- hardware systems

I previously worked on:
- hacking together methods and tools for computational physics in neutrino phenomenology.
- building systems and AI for robotics in AgTech and automated precision agriculture.
- building, maintaining, and improving tools and systems for on-prem IT/network observability.

I'm currently hacking on an intersection of:
- rust, go, zig, and the ideas behind modern day high performance programming.
- building low overhead, safe, high performance systems for AI inference, media processing, and computational physics.

I started writing code and tinkering with systems as a hobby over a decade ago, beginning my career as a scripter/modder for the GTA series of video games. If I'm not upto something, I usually spend my time recreationally learning about and hopping between fields such as:

- quantum information & computing
- numerical methods & analysis
- scientific computing
- data science & data engineering
- AI/ML/DL/CV/NLP
- robotics & automation
- web, mobile, & desktop development
- classical information/coding theory
- game development
- systems engineering
- IT & network engineering
- computation theory
- programming language design & type theory
- devops & infrastructure design

in no particular order.
